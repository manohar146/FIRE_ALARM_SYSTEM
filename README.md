# FIRE_ALARM_SYSTEM
This project is a smart fire detection system using an ESP32 microcontroller, flame sensor, buzzer, red/green LEDs, 16x2 I2C LCD, and Blynk IoT platform. When a fire is detected, the system:
•	Activates a blinking red LED and buzzer
•	Displays warning messages on the LCD
•	Sends a real-time update to the Blynk web dashboard
•	Shows “Normal” status with a green LED when no fire is detected
